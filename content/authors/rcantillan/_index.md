I am a doctoral candidate in Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. My research interests lie at the intersection of economic sociology, social stratification, and network science. My doctoral research uses a structural and network perspective to analyze the patterns of mobility, diffusion, and segregation in labor markets from an intragenerational viewpoint.
